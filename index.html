            This visualization uses  2010 to 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) data. It seeks to tell the story to shed light on various statistics such as the population count, gender ratio and the relationship between Per Capita Income and Poverty in various states. It finds out which states have highest overall and child poverty in relation to per capita income distribution. Finally, this visualization takes a look at the racial make up of various US census regions. </p>
        <p class="description">
          The visualization contains 3 charts, viz.
           (i) Population Overview
           (ii) Income, Poverty & Unemployment
           (iii) Racial Distribution Per Region
        </p>
        <p class="description">
           <b>"Population Overview" chart</b> is a filled map giving views with two different aspects captured in the data set. Overview of total population per state and its gender ratio.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>"Income, Poverty & Unemployment" chart</b> is  a scattered plot that captures the relation ship between per capita income and poverty in each US State.  This is a discrete quantitative vs continous quantitative plot. Circle is the shape used. The position of circle represents this relationshiop. The size of the circle represents another key indicator:  '% of child poverty'. The color of the circle represents percentage unemployment in each state.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          <b>"Racial Distribution per Region" chart</b> is a bar chart representing racial make up of population across 4 US census regions. It is plotted against regions and 6 racial groupings Vs the percentage population of each race, which is a continuous variable for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="heading3">Clarifications</p>
        <p class="question">(1) Does the narrative visualization correctly follow the hybrid structure as stated by the essay?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes. This visualization uses <b>"interactive slideshow"</b> hybrid structure. As indicated above, there are three distinct types of charts that takes the end user through several years of ACS data. While traversing through a given aspect (chart type) over the years, consistency of the view is preserved.</p>
        <p class="question">(2) Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize scenes?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes. The first chart type, focuses on the overview population. Next it focuses on a level of detail, that looks at relationship of variables like income, general poverty, child poverty and unemployment. Finally, the third scene focuses on racial composition of US census regions.</p>
        <p class="question">(3) Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize annotations?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes, to a great extent. Charts are using tooltips and annotations where possible.</p>
        <p class="question">(4) Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize parameters?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes. The scenes have a slide bar that let the user traverse and choose the year that the they want to see represented in visualization. </p>
        <p class="question">(5) Does the narrative visualization effectively utilize triggers?</p>
        <p class="answer">Yes. The provision to choose scene type is the trigger in this visualization. The numbered triggered show up at the top right corner of the chart.</p>
